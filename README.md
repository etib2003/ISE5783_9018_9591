Mini-project in Software Engeneering

The Simple 3D Graphics Engine is a project focused on learning software engineering principles. 
It provides an implementation of a basic 3D graphics engine, 
with features such as parametric shapes, geometric shapes, color management, rendering, camera manipulation, and lighting effects. 
The project emphasizes refactoring and the use of design patterns like the builder pattern, 
wrapper pattern, and composite pattern. 
It serves as a platform to gain practical experience in software development 
and explore the fundamentals of creating virtual scenes using light projection onto objects in a defined 3D space.
